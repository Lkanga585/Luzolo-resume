        Hi, my name is Luzolo Kanga. I am 38 years old, born in Luanda Angola
        and raised in the East Bay Area. <br />
        Growing up I have had a love and hate relationship with the evolution of
        app and social media. <br />
        I, like some oe most people, believe that apps and social media were met
        to make our life simpler <br />
        to access and share information and resource. My goal with the bootcamp
        course is to learn the skills <br />
        and in the future develop my own website and app, or the next software
        application the simplify our <br />
        lives. Having no previous experiences in coding or software engineering
        but I am excited learn, fail, <br />
        study and succeed on this next venture.

        I have been working at the Getty Museum as of September of 2022. I don't not work <br>
